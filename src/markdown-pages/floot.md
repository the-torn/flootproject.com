# Floot

Floot (Fair Loot) is a blind drop implementation of Loot, designed to address [security concerns](https://medium.com/@iamthetorn/stop-forking-loot-its-kind-of-broken-f1a1c986784d) with the smart contract design of [Loot](http://lootproject.com/). A secondary goal is to reduce gas costs for users.

Advantages of Floot include:
* Fair and random distribution of tokens.
* Secure against frontrunning, dark pools, and manipulation by miners.
* Secure against cheating by the NFT creator.
* No contract owner and no founder allocation.
* A 31% reduction in gas cost per mint.

Limitations:
* The tokens are not revealed until the end of the token distribution.
